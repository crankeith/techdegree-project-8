# SQL Library Manager

This application uses Sequelize, SQLite 3 and Pug to provide a front end interface to perform CRUD operations on a list of library books. 

This is for unit 8 of my techdegree through treehouse. 

## Extra Credit
- I've update the font, colors and a few minor layout items in the styling
- I've added in a search feature that uses a LIKE condition on all fields
- I've added in a reset button to remove all filtering and reset the grid
- I've added in pagination to the bottom of the grid
- I've added in a page size selector and set the default to 5 per page
